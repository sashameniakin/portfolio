# AdamKeyes Landing Page

I have built the AdamKeyes landing page. The website is responsive, you can use it on your phone, tablet or normal desktop.
Here is the link: https://portfolio-self-pi-88.vercel.app/

## TechStack

- React
- StyledComponents
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the app
